        India made its debut as a Test-cricket-playing-nation in England in 1932 
        led by CK Nayudu, well before Indian independence. The team performed well, 
        with Mohammad Nissar taking 5-93 and 1-42 in the match against England. 
        The match was given test status despite being only 3 days in length. 
        England, batting first, scored 258 with Nissar cleaning up the openers 
        and tailenders. However the Indian team failed to capitalize on their 
        bowling performance, all out for 189 with CK Nayudu the top scorer with 40 runs. 
        England went on to score 275 and set India a target of 346, which always 
        seemed out of the visitor's grasp. India were all out for 187 and lost by 158 runs.
